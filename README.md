<h2>Group "Spiel mir das Lied vom Code" - Zenke Prostka </h2>

<p>
We chose to complete exercise three using java because we think java does well handling file 
handling operations and has a very good support for object-oriented programming. We would have 
preferred to use Python ( as there were snippets of Python-code available ) but we already 
completed exercise two using Python.

<b>Problem</b> <br>
<p>
We encountered a problem when we started implementing the "createBoxFilter()" method inside KernelFactory. 
The given UML clearly states that it should return a two dimensional array of integers, 
however the boxFilter requires decimal numbers ( f.e. every Element in 3x3 boxFilter has a value of 1/9, 
which can not appropriately be represented as Integer ). We were therefore left with a choice between 
</p>
<br> 
<ol>
<li>Write createBoxFilter() using Integers and misrepresent its values </li>
<li>Write createBoxFilter() using doubles and interfere with the UML </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, we decided to stick with <b>......TODO......</b></p> 

<ul>
<b>TO DO!</b>
<li>talk about imageArray attr in Image class</li>
